Peter's idea:
On "order" page, have various checkboxes with textboxes underneath where users can check what they would generally like us to do, and then specify with depth exactly
what they would like us to do. Also include a separate textbox where users can specify anything that the checkboxes didn't cover. Also on this page include
a pay section w/ PayPal. After form / payment get submitted, payment goes through, plan gets sent to us. If plan is obscene, we refund user and let them know that they
were refunded and why the plan was cancelled.
